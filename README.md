Project: Cleaning and Analysis of Excel Data

This project focuses on cleaning, analyzing, and visualizing data from two Excel files:

us_president_data.xlsx: Contains data about US presidents.
bike_users.xlsx: Contains data about bike users (potentially).

Cleaning Steps (us_president_data.xlsx):

Open the file in Microsoft Excel.
Review Data:

Standardize formatting:
Ensure consistent date formats.

Handle missing values:
Delete rows with excessive missing values.
Impute missing values with appropriate methods.
Remove irrelevant columns after careful evaluation.

Analysis and Visualization (bike_users.xlsx):

Explore the data using descriptive statistics.
Create visualizations:
Histograms, bar charts, or line charts to understand data distribution.
Scatter plots to identify potential relationships between variables.
Box plots to compare data across groups.
Pivot tables:
Summarize data by grouping and aggregating relevant columns.
Analyze trends and patterns across different categories (user demographics, usage patterns).

Dashboards:
Combine multiple visualizations and pivot tables on a single dashboard for interactive exploration.
Tools: Microsoft Excel

Expected Outcomes:

A cleaned and organized us_president_data.xlsx file.
Actionable insights and trends uncovered from the bike_users.xlsx data through visualizations and pivot tables.
